This file goes with part 8 of the first lab.  The idea is to give you
some practice thinking about the names of functions.  The problem is a
simple one, so we're doing the software equivalent of shooting a fly
with an elephant gun, but because the problem is so simple, it makes
it easy to have a short practice session.

Here is the problem:

  - Suggest three different functions that might be useful in
    implementing `brightness`.

  - For each function, suggest three possible names.

  - For each function, say which name you think is most appropriate
    and *why*.



Function #1: skipping the comments in the pgm file

  Job: Skips all the comments in a pgm file

  Candidate names: 

  Best name: skip_comments

  Why the given name is the best: Because it exactly describes what
  the function does.





Function #2: read in the header data of a pgm file

  Job: read in the header data that come after the comments

  Candidate names: read_in, read_header, 

  Best name: read_header

  Why the given name is the best: because it exactly describe what 
  the function does in reading in the header





Function #3: 

  Job: getting the average brightness of the file

  Candidate names: getBrightness, getAvBrightness,  avgBrightness

  Best name: getAvBrightness

  Why the given name is the best: Has all three descriptors in the name 
  which makes it clear and concise.
